## Introduction

The FMC Route Generator is a program designed to convert a CSV file from Google MyMaps into a Flight Management Computer (FMC) route that can be inserted into the GeoFS (GeoFlight Simulator) FMC. This tool is helpful for virtual pilots who want to create flight plans based on MyMaps data for use in GeoFS.

## Instructions

While using this program, please follow these instructions to ensure it works correctly:

- Export only a single layer from your Google MyMaps.
- Ensure that the exported layer contains only waypoints or markers, and not any lines or other elements.
- For additional guidance, refer to the [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yf9DV-8O4OA).
